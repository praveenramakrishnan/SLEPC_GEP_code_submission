This repository contains the source code for solving the generalized eigenvalue problem (GEP) 
arising in characteristic mode analysis.

There are two directories in the repository:
1) src
2) example_freq_100MHz_epsr_4-1j_ur_1

The directory "src" contains the FORTRAN source files, "main.F90" and "module_file.F90", and a makefile.
The "main.F90" file contains the source code for solving the GEP using the
SLEPc library and "module_file.F90" contains a subroutine to read in the input data files.
The details about the code can be found in their respective header files and the comments therein.

The directory "example_freq_100MHz_eps_4-1j_ur_1" contains a set of examples for the solution of the GEP.
The directory contains the subdirectory called "data" which has the input files: 
"real_parts.txt", "imag_parts.txt", "weight_matrix.txt", 
and also a file "zero_matrix.txt", which serves as the imaginary part of the weight matrix. 
Apart from the "data" directory, there are a number of directories with bach scripts for the execution of the source files.
This includes either direct or iterative linear solve in combination with various methods like
arnoldi, arpack, krylovschur, ciss (see SLEPc manual for details.).
Any case can be run using typing "./runfile" on the bash terminal.

The instructions on installing SLEPc library can be found on their official website (https://slepc.upv.es/).
SLEPc uses the library PETSc (https://petsc.org/release/) for underlying linear algebraic structures.

While installing PETSc, the following configuration will be useful and will download and install the required packages:
./configure --download-superlu_dist --download-parmetis --download-metis --download-make --download-mumps --download-scalapack --    with-debugging=0 --with-scalar-type=complex

For SLEPc, the ARPACK library can be installed with the following configuration:
/configure --download-arpack
