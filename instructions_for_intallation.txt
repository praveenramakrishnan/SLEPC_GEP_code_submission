1) The directory contains the following files:
    1.petsc.tar.gz
    2.slepc.tar.gz
    3.slepc_cpp_different_solvers
    4.slepc_fortran_different_solvers

    You may unzip the petsc and slepc libraries using the commands:
    tar xzf petsc.tar.gz
    tar xzf slepc.tar.gz

2) First step is to install petsc and slepc.
   For this, the environment variables, PETSC_DIR, PETSC_ARCH and SLEPC_DIR have to be set.
   To do this open the file ~/.bashrc and enter the following three lines 
   ("path_to_slepc" and "path_to_slepc" have to be replaced by the actual paths of the directories":
   export PETSC_DIR="path_to_petsc"
   export PETSC_ARCH=arch-linux-c-opt-complex-mumps
   export SLEPC_DIR="path_to_slepc"

3) Next, go to the directory "petsc" and run the bash script "runfile_configure_petsc".
   This will start the configuration. Wait for it to complete.
   (At this stage if there is some dependency issue, an error message will be displayed).
   After successful configuration, a message will appear build petsc using make.
   Upon successfuly building petsc library, one can move on to building slepc.

4) Go to the directory "slepc" and run the bash script "runfile_configure_petsc".
   Finish the configuration and build.

5) Now, to run FORTRAN code, go to the directory "slepc_fortran_different_solvers".
   This directory contains the following sub direcories:
   "src", "example_freq_100MHz_epsr_4-1j_ur_1".
   A "README" file is also provided here explaining the structure of the directories.
   The directory "src" contains the source codes.
   The directory "example_freq_100MHz_epsr_4-1j_ur_1" contains a subdirectory for "data"
   and other subdirectories running the example using different methods available in SLEPC.
   To run any example, go to the corresponding folder and run the bash script provided.

   For instance, to run the example using krylovschur method along with mumps linear solver, 
   go to "slepc_fortran_different_solvers/example_freq_100MHz_epsr_4-1j_ur_1/iterative_gmres_krylov_schur"
   and run the bash script "runfile".

6) The folder "slepc_cpp_different_solvers" contains the C++ source codes and all the examples can be run
   in a similar way as mentioned above for FORTRAN code.
